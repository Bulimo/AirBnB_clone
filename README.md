# AirBnB_clone

## About

    The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
    Not all the featires of the website are implemented, only some so as to cover all fundamental 
    concepts of the higher level programming track.
    On completetion, we will have a complete web application composed by:

        . A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
        . A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
        . A database or files that store data (data = objects)
        . An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

### The Console

    This is the command interpreter. It is the first step towards building the full web application: the AirBnB clone.
    From the console we will be able to:

        . Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
        . Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
        . Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
        . Update attributes of an object
        . Destroy an object
